# Diffusion — current status

Diffusion is a quiet thinking medium for ideas before commitment. This file describes the current `main` branch: what works, which subsystem owns it, what was freshly verified, and what remains incomplete. It is not a changelog. Historical phase reports and prior verification records remain under [`docs/history/`](docs/history/README.md).

## What works now

- **Spatial Field interaction:** create, edit, select, lasso, move, pan, zoom, semantic disclosure, Regions, and Crystals. Pointer-frequency camera and drag work stays outside React state.
- **Commands and ownership:** one semantic command registry feeds menus, keyboard shortcuts, the command palette, and help. The Field title owns Field/project operations; the application menu owns global/view operations.
- **Thinking workflows:** Threads, Deep Dive, explicit Crystal confirmation, Fork, Diffuse, contextual actions, and action-specific transient AI results.
- **Sources and evidence:** bounded extraction for UTF-8 text, Markdown, and common code formats; explicit candidate/read/assessment stages; passage provenance and Source validation.
- **Persistence:** local-first Dexie storage, in-place migrations, single-flight saves, bounded undo/redo, and portable project export.
- **Optional services:** manual use requires no provider. AI and discovery are independent capabilities and may be absent without breaking the Field.
- **Appearance:** independent Theme/Profile, Field Style, Accent, and Image Atmosphere axes; Field Presence; Ambient Motion; Reduced Motion; local adaptive image recommendations; and safe migration of prior device preferences. Appearance remains presentation/device state and never enters canonical `ProjectState`.
- **Field materials:** Paper Texture (default), Topography, Threads, Waves, and Silk are the complete production Field Style set. They are lazy, viewport-bounded, screen-space backgrounds that preserve the DOM Thought layer, SVG phenomenon architecture, single camera authority, and interaction grammar.
- **Thought geometry:** ordinary Thoughts use bounded content-derived compact/regular/wide widths. Width is frozen during editing, then reclassified after commit. Mounted interaction uses measured DOM geometry; bounded kind-aware estimates mirror CSS geometry before mount and during semantic disclosure.
- **Desktop architecture:** Tauri wraps the same frontend through platform adapters; secrets stay behind browser-session or native credential boundaries.

## Ownership map

| Concern | Owner | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical semantics and authority | `src/core/` | Thoughts, relations, Regions, Crystals, Threads, worlds, history, and permission gates. AI cannot commit canonical state. |
| Field and spatial hot path | `src/field/` | Camera, gesture state, pointer capture, geometry cache, culling, direct world transforms, and SVG phenomena. |
| Product shell and transient UI | `src/ui/`, especially `src/ui/workspace/` and `src/ui/surfaces/` | Commands, input ownership, settings, focus return, Threads, and presentation composition. |
| Appearance and Field presentation | `src/ui/appearance.ts`, `src/ui/fieldBackgrounds/`, `src/ui/atmosphere.*` | Device-local visual settings and pointer-inert viewport materials. No canonical project or camera ownership. |
| AI runtime | `src/ai/` | Provider registry, transport, bounded context, operation lifecycle, and validated possibilities. |
| Discovery and evidence | `src/discovery/`, `src/evidence/`, `internal/discovery-engine/` | Candidate discovery, explicit read/extract, evidence envelopes, and optional assessment. |
| Persistence | `src/storage/` | Dexie repository, migration, save queue, and recovery boundaries. |
| Gateway | `server/` | Origin/token guard, provider wire adapters, bounded requests, and normalized evidence HTTP seam. |
| Desktop | `src/platform/`, `src-tauri/` | One frontend, narrow native capabilities, OS credential access, native provider transport, and discovery launcher. |

## Fresh stabilization verification

The following results were captured while stabilizing current `main` from baseline `d4870b5`:

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Passed |
| `pnpm run check:offline` | Passed: 243 offline contract tests; locale and source-size checks passed |
| `pnpm test` | Passed: 41 files, 307 tests |
| `pnpm run build` | Passed; Vite retained the >500 kB main-chunk warning |
| `git diff --check` | Passed after the final documentation pass |
| `pnpm run test:e2e` | Passed twice consecutively: 148 passed, 8 skipped on each run; one worker, no retries |
| `pnpm run build:discovery` | Passed on Linux/WSL2; produced a current 10.8 MiB sidecar |
| `pnpm run check:discovery` | Passed after the sidecar build |
| `pnpm run test:discovery` | Passed: 79 tests |
| `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | **UNVERIFIED**: compilation stopped because Linux `glib-2.0` / `gobject-2.0` development libraries are unavailable |
| `pnpm run smoke:providers` | **UNVERIFIED**: 0 live providers verified; all four skipped because no credentials are available |

The five previously recorded deterministic Playwright failures were resolved without retries or skips: transient Escape/focus handoff, Base UI Home semantics, Settings motion contract sampling, and exact Thread camera return now test their real ownership contracts. Full-suite runs also exposed and resolved stale Dust selectors, semantic-zoom test assumptions, and exit-timing ownership.

## Important limitations

- **Windows/native acceptance is UNVERIFIED.** This WSL2 environment cannot validate Windows display scaling, Chinese IME in WebView2, native dialog/filesystem scope, OS credential persistence, installer behavior, or a Windows-packaged sidecar.
- **Native Linux compilation is UNVERIFIED.** Rust/Cargo are present, but required GLib/GObject development packages are not installed; no Tauri window or native package was produced.
- **Live AI and discovery are UNVERIFIED.** No provider or search credentials are present. Fixture/contract suites passed, but no external service was contacted.
- **Unsupported rich formats remain metadata-only.** PDF, image, Office, audio, and video extraction/understanding is not implemented.
- **Multi-tab project write coordination is not implemented.** Use one editing tab per project. Actual IndexedDB disk latency remains unmeasured.
- **The production build retains a large-chunk warning.** The main bundle is deliberately not split without evidence that a stable product boundary yields a net runtime benefit.
- **Real-image Image Atmosphere coverage is bounded.** Unit/browser contracts and curated captures exist, but a broader corpus of difficult real images has not been systematically validated.

## Next meaningful work

1. Perform Windows/Tauri acceptance, including native credential, dialog, scaling, IME, packaged-sidecar, and installer flows.
2. Run operator-authorized smoke tests against at least one real model provider and one real discovery source.
3. Revisit bundle splitting only when measured startup/interaction data or a natural lazy-loaded boundary justifies the added loading and chunking complexity.
4. Expand real-image Image Atmosphere stress validation without changing canonical project semantics.
